<h1>A simple user directory built with react js</h1>

Just playing around with state again, css modules, reusable components, validation and additionally integrating error modals to mimick how this micro project would be some sort of simple feature.

Can be ran with `npm install && npm start`

Not a whole lot going on with it otherwise, just a simple prototype as a product of learning react js.
